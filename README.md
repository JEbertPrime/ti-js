## Introduction

This is an effort to write a TI-Basic to JavaScript transpiler and runtime.

Note that this project is ***not*** another TI-83 or TI-84 emulator. Those exist elsewhere.

Rather, the two goals are:
1. Bring the TI-Basic language to life
2. Show off TI-Basic programs in the browser

## Setup

*Proposed setup:*

Import [tipiler.js](/src/tipiler.js) to convert your TI-Basic text into a `.ti.js` file.

Import [tilib.js](/src/tilib.js) to run your `.ti.js` file.

## Usage

*Proposed usage:*

See the [sample](/sample) directory for an example.
