This directory has a few examples of usage.

There's [loop.8xp.txt](loop.8xp.txt), a sample program written in TI-Basic, and its transpiled counterpart [loop.8xp.js](loop.8xp.js).

In [parse.js](parse.js) you can see how that conversion might happen.

In [test.html](test.html) and [playground.js](playground.js) you can see an interactive transpiler and program output.
